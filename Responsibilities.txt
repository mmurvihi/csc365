Erik Christensen:
Honestly did all the leg work to figure out how to set up connections
then implement the SQL queries into the Java code.
He pretty much made sure all the non-functional requirements were good
and did all of FR3, FR4, FR5 - both the queries and java code.

Jack Langston:
Jack did the hardest SQL queries as he did both FR2, and FR6. He made
sure they would output the right results and helped write the java code for FR2.

Matthew Mazzagatte:
Created the query for FR1 and wrote most of the java code for FR1.
Helped implement and debug the java code for FR2, and wrote up this report.

Jason:
Helped establish connection to the database, wrote shell script to run files, wrote up the readme.
Helped write SQL to prevent conflict between queries

Margot:
Helped finalize the java code for FR2 and make sure the data was formatted correctly.
Helped format confirmation and insert statements for updating tables.
